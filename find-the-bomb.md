# Find the Bomb
Create a function that finds the word bomb in the given string. If found, return 'Duck!!!', otherwise return 'There is no bomb, relax.'

```js
bomb("There is a bomb.") // should return  "Duck!!!"

bomb("Hey, did you think there is a bomb?")  // should return "Duck!!!"

bomb("This goes boom!!!") // should return "There is no bomb, relax."
```
### Notes
- bomb may appear in different cases (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, mixed).
